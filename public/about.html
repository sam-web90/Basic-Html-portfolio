<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Sam. I’m learning web development and JavaScript step by step. I’m
  currently focused on building small projects to get better at HTML, CSS, and
  JavaScript. I don’t come from a tech background, but I’ve committed myself to
  learning daily — even if it’s slow sometimes.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy solving logic problems and figuring out how things work under the
  hood. Right now, I’m following courses by Jonas Schmedtmann and Angela Yu to
  build a solid foundation. I’ve also been revisiting math to sharpen my
  thinking.
</p>
<p>
  I’m not perfect, and I’ve doubted myself a lot. But I’ve decided to stop
  running from challenges and start showing up for myself. This portfolio is
  part of that journey.
